echo SESSION PERSISTENCE FIX DEPLOYMENT  
echo ===================================
echo.
echo 📋 What was fixed:
echo   ✅ Session config: resave=true, saveUninitialized=true, rolling=true
echo   ✅ Added explicit session.save() in login process
echo   ✅ Enhanced session debugging with cookie details
echo   ✅ Added session debug endpoint: /api/auth/debug-session
echo   ✅ Improved session middleware for production
echo.
echo 🎯 The Problem:
echo   Sessions were being created but not persisted due to restrictive settings
echo   This caused immediate 401 errors after successful login
echo.
echo 🔧 The Solution:
echo   Updated session configuration to ensure proper session persistence
echo   Added explicit session saving and comprehensive debugging
echo.
echo 📤 DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
echo   1. Upload your updated 'dist' folder to the server
echo   2. Run on server: docker-compose down
echo   3. Run on server: docker-compose up -d
echo   4. Test login at: https://southdelhirealty.com/auth
echo   5. Check debug endpoint: https://southdelhirealty.com/api/auth/debug-session
echo.
echo 🐛 If login still fails:
echo   - Check server logs: docker-compose logs app
echo   - Test debug endpoint to see session state
echo   - Verify MemoryStore is working properly
echo.
echo ✅ Local build completed successfully!
echo 🚀 Files ready for deployment in 'dist' folder!
